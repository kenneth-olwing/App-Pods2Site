# App::Pods2Site 1.001

This module provides a command to easily create a simple HTML site from pods, by
default the core docs, scripts, pragmas and other modules in the Perl distro
it is installed in, but it can also handle everything reachable through @INC and/or
arbitrary trees. If necessary, the set of pods can be trimmed based on queries.
Once a site has been constructed, it can be efficiently updated with new module installs
by running the command again.

It is inspired by the 'ap-update-html' command provided with an ActivePerl implementation.
